                    <!-- About me info here -->
                    <p>
                        Welcome to my portfolio! I went to the University of North Texas studying biochemistry to pursue a career in the 
                        medical field. I built my whole undergraduate around it and quite frankly if I had a chance to go back and do things differently, 
                        I would. Everything I did was to build the perfect resume to get into a medical school. I worked as a pharmacy technician 
                        to get a sense of medication, I worked as a scribe to see how it was like shadowing a physician, I aided the administration department to learn about the
                        different perspectives of working in a hospital. I learned many things and met a diverse amount of people. I had good times and 
                        bad times but the one thing I realized later on was that I wasn't simply enoying it. 
                        
                        </br>
                        </br>

                        Which leads me to where I am today. I have always had an interest in coding. And after that realization I finally took a step forward 
                        towards it. Being 25 I absolutely had no idea where to start. I found out about SMU through one of my friends and I said 'why not' so 
                        I applied and started my journey. Ever since that day I have not regretted a single choice I have made. I fell in love with learning about
                        being a full-stack developer and I have enjoyed every step of the way. From working in the front-end then the back-end there wasn't a moment
                        where I felt like I was making the wrong decision. Making this portfolio wasn't just a task that I had to do it is something that I actually 
                        was excited and wanted to do and for the first time it just felt right.

                        </br>
                        </br>

                        Follow me on my journey as I continue to broaden my skillset and continue to create and produce work that I can be proud of and for 
                        the people that I believe in! Thank you!
